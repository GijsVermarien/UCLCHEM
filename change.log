# Cosmic ray attenuation

Update to the handling of the cosmic ray ionization rate and H2 dissociation rate to be dependent on the column density of a cloud. Includes switches for activation and upper/lower limits. Switches are defaulted to off (i.e. standard UCLCHEM handling) so must be actived to use.
