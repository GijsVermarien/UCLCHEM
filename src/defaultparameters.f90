!radfield in habing, cosmic ray ionisation rates as multiple of standard

!Scale freeze out efficiency by an aribtrary value. 
fr=1.0;

!Size of cloud set by inner and outer radii (rin and rout). used to calculate extinction.
!baseAv is extinction at cloud edge
!points is number of parcels to run model for. spaced  evenly between rin and rout
rout=0.05;rin=0;baseAv=2.0; points=1


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!Behavioural switches
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!switch (0/1) -> finish model run at (finalTime/finalDens)
switch=0

!collapse (0/1/2/3/4) 1/0 are on/off for standard free-fall. 2/3/4 are different collapse modes noted in cloud.f90
!collape=0/1 ONLY if not using cloud.f90
!In all cases collapse=1 lets chem.f90 know it should call  densdot in the physics module to get time derivative of density and include it in ODES
!Any other values tells it to use density value as set by physics module
collapse=1
!for collapse=1 can introduce factor bc to slow freefall
bc=1.0


!phase chooses behaviour. Phase=1 runs a simple cloud and Phase=2 runs the physics of the chosen module (eg.hot core or c-shock)
phase=1;

!non-thermal Desorption. Turn it all on/offwith desorb. Can also turn off h2, cosmic ray induced and uv induced individually.
desorb=1;
h2desorb=1;crdesorb=1;uvdesorb=1 !Non-thermal desorption methods (roberts et al. 2007)
thermdesorb=1 !continuous thermal desorption -not currently recommended so turned off by default.

!Set to 1 to immediately add all grain surface material to gas phase.
instantSublimation=0

!ion sets ionization fraction of carbon. See chem.f90:initialise
ion=2

!switches for the cosmic ray ionization dependency on column density
!all switches below must have dependency activates to work
crDependency=0 
hDiss=0 !toggles the CR H2 dission rate dependency on/off (1/0)
ionModel=0 !toggles between the L model (0) and the H model (1) dependency
zetaScale=1.0 !a factor to simply scale the ionization dependency if desired.


!cloud module specific variable for phase 2, temp profile depends on mass of star
!Tempindx selects mass: 1=1Msol,2=5,3=10M,4=15M,5=25M,6=60M
tempIndx=3


!cshock module specific variable, uncomment or comment as  needed

! Initial Abundances
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

!You can scale the abundances of all elements heavier than He by this factor
metallicity=1.0

!Below we have some initial elemental abundances which are then scaled by the metallicty above
! fh is fraction of H initially in H atoms. Total H is always 1.


! initial fractional abundances of elements(from Jenkins et al. 2009 Table 4)
! We use the heavily depleted case as we expect most UCLCHEM models to treat gas where
! dust formation has occured and elemets are depleted.
fh=0.5;fhe = 0.1;fc  = 1.77d-04;fo  = 3.34d-04;fn  = 6.18d-05

fp=7.78d-08 !ffe=2.01d-7; 
ff = 3.6d-08 !fp depleted 1/100 of solar from Asplund 2009


! !initial fractional abundances of elements(from Asplund et al. 2009 ARAA table 1 -SOLAR)
! !note fh is fraction of H initially in H atoms. Total H is always 1.

! fp=2.57d-09 ; ff = 3.6d-08 !fp depleted 1/100 of solar

! These elements are not typically used. We do not recommend any particular value

!Input and output Files
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

!A full output of abundances is written by default. Additionally, name species here for 
!a columnated output of time,density,temperature and abundances of those species
!Fortran will reject this array if species with shorter names are not padded with spaces at the end.
!array commented so it does not override array in input file. 
!If no array is passed in input, no column file is written
!outSpecies=(/'CO ','H2S','OCS','CS '/)

!writeStep sets how often columns written out. Columns written every n steps for writeStep=n.
writeStep=1

!Final abundances are written to abundSaveFile if one is provided
!if abundLoadFile is provided, the initial abundances are read from that file.
abundSaveFile="output/start.dat"
!Full output written to outputFlie
outputFile="output/full.dat"
!columnated output of time,dens,temp and outSpecies written to column file
!only works if outSpecies list is supplied via python wrap or input parameter file
columnFile='output/column.dat'
